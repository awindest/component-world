# Component World
Visualizing Talend Studio 8 component icons in 3D space in the browser using an image atlas / sprite sheet and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) instancing.

**[Demo](https://yizhe-ang.github.io/threejs-instancing-images/)**



Built using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [Threlte](https://threlte.xyz/).

Used [svelte-adapter-github](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-adapter-github) to publish statically to github pages.

Talend Studio 8 component icon images were scraped from https://talendforge.org and then aggregated into a transparent image or sprite sheet using [Processing v4] (https://processing.org/).

## Attribution
